/* ======================= Some typical usecases: ===============
 *
 * (1) always get the pose of the most recent frame:
 *     -> Implement [publishCamPose].
 *
 * (2) always get the depthmap of the most recent keyframe
 *     -> Implement [pushDepthImageFloat] (use inverse depth in [image], and pose / frame information from [KF]).
 *
 * (3) accumulate final model
 *     -> Implement [publishKeyframes] (skip for final!=false), and accumulate frames.
 *
 * (4) get evolving model in real-time
 *     -> Implement [publishKeyframes] (update all frames for final==false).
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * ==================== How to use the structs: ===================
 * [FrameShell]: minimal struct kept for each frame ever tracked.
 *      ->camToWorld = camera to world transformation
 *      ->poseValid = false if [camToWorld] is invalid (only happens for frames during initialization).
 *      ->trackingRef = Shell of the frame this frame was tracked on.
 *      ->id = ID of that frame, starting with 0 for the very first frame.
 *
 *      ->incoming_id = ID passed into [addActiveFrame( ImageAndExposure* image, int id )].
 *	->timestamp = timestamp passed into [addActiveFrame( ImageAndExposure* image, int id )] as image.timestamp.
 *
 * [FrameHessian]
 *      ->immaturePoints: contains points that have not been "activated" (they do however have a depth initialization).
 *      ->pointHessians: contains active points.
 *      ->pointHessiansMarginalized: contains marginalized points.
 *      ->pointHessiansOut: contains outlier points.
 *
 *      ->frameID: incremental ID for keyframes only.
 *      ->shell: corresponding [FrameShell] struct.
 *
 *
 * [CalibHessian]
 *      ->fxl(), fyl(), cxl(), cyl(): get optimized, most recent (pinhole) camera intrinsics.
 *
 *
 * [PointHessian]
 * 	->u,v: pixel-coordinates of point.
 *      ->idepth_scaled: inverse depth of point.
 *                       DO NOT USE [idepth], since it may be scaled with [SCALE_IDEPTH] ... however that is currently set to 1 so never mind.
 *      ->host: pointer to host-frame of point.
 *      ->status: current status of point (ACTIVE=0, INACTIVE, OUTLIER, OOB, MARGINALIZED)
 *      ->numGoodResiduals: number of non-outlier residuals supporting this point (approximate).
 *      ->maxRelBaseline: value roughly proportional to the relative baseline this point was observed with (0 = no baseline).
 *                        points for which this value is low are badly contrained.
 *      ->idepth_hessian: hessian value (inverse variance) of inverse depth.
 *
 * [ImmaturePoint]
 * 	->u,v: pixel-coordinates of point.
 *      ->idepth_min, idepth_max: the initialization sais that the inverse depth of this point is very likely
 *        between these two thresholds (their mean being the best guess)
 *      ->host: pointer to host-frame of point.
